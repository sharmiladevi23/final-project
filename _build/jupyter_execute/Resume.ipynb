    "# Aquaculture Monitoring System Using IoT\n",
    "Developed an IoT-driven system for real-time monitoring of water quality parameters (e.g., pH) in aquaculture farms. Integrated Arduino and ESP8266 with sensors for data collection, leading to efficient monitoring. Applied machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics, optimizing resource usage and improving farm sustainability. Designed a cloud-based data visualization interface to track trends and automate farm operations, ensuring optimal environmental conditions for aquaculture growth. \n",
    "# Blackjack Strategy Optimization Using Statistical Analysis \n",
    "Analyzed strategies for minimizing losses in Blackjack by simulating 1 million rounds of gameplay, leveraging Python for data preprocessing, EV analysis, and visualization. Developed a \"Basic Strategy\" framework using statistical models to quantify the house edge and guide optimal player decisions. Demonstrated expertise in data simulation, statistical learning, and visualization tools to provide a comprehensive risk analysis.\n",
